# Es6 Essentials 

## Modules

One of the most important approaches to software development is modularity.
So what does modularity exactly mean? It means that we can split the code of a program into many reusable pieces(usually grouped in files). In software engineering, modularity refers to the extent to which a software/Web application may be divided into smaller modules.
Modularity is successful because developers use prewritten code, which saves resources. Overall, modularity provides greater software development manageability.
That’s why ES6 introduced two new keywords: export and import.

<br/>JavaScript types that we can export or import are :

<br/>String
<br/>Number
<br/>Function
<br/>Objects
<br/>Array
<br/>Anything ...

## Type
Let’s assume we want to use a code that is created in another module, all we have to do is import that module in our work file.

<br/> The two types of export are:

<br/> + Named exports: Zero or more exports per module
<br/> + Default exports: One per module
