## Destructuring

ES6 Destructuring
Variables solve the issue of redundant code. But, it makes the code longer and harder to read. This is where destructuring comes into play. In simpler terms, the destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.
All we need to do is to put the variable inside two curly brackets in the declaration.
